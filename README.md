## My process

This is basically my first project practicing everything I know about CSS and HTML.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I realized that all the other projects I did, copying and pasting the style and design, did not help me much in learning. In this one I was able to practice from scratch and realize where I can improve. I learned flexbox and grid!
